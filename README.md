# My-Resume

This is my latex resume. Feel free to change it up to whatever. It is straighforward to change the contents of it.

## Package Installation

Make sure to have the right latex packages installed which can be done manually or through *tllocalmgr-git* from the AUR

### Packages

## Easy Method

Go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), then upload *bilal.tex* and *bilal.cls*. It already has all packages installed and will install with no errors.
