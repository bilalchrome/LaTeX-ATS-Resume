# My-Resume

This is my **Latex ATS Friendly** resume. Feel free to change it up to whatever by editing *bilal.tex* file.

## Easy Method

Go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), then upload *bilal.tex* and *bilal.cls*. It already has all packages installed and will compile with no errors.

## Hard Method

Make sure to have the right latex packages installed which can be done manually or through *tllocalmgr-git* from the AUR

### Packages

+ natbib
+ parskip
+ arrat
+ ifthen
+ graohicx
+ geometry

## Tips

If resume ends up being two pages, you can change the font or margins in the *bilal.cls* file.
